# LRU-Cache-Implementation-Using-java
This project implements an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache in Java using a combination of HashMap and Circular Doubly Linked List. The LRU cache efficiently supports O(1) time complexity for both get and put operations. In LRU cache, when the capacity is full, the least recently used entry is removed.
